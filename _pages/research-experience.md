# 2. Research Experiences
## 2.1 Big Data, Machine Learning & AI
### 2.1.1 Quantitive Finance and Web Scraping
- *Hubei University & DigQuant College*
- 2020.07 - 2020.09
- **Abstract**: 1. Using stock pools in the Chinese financial market as the object, explore the predictive ability of different indicators on profitability; 2. Build an optimized asset portfolio to maximize its return during the backtesting period; Having used Bollinger Bands strategy, resistance support strategy, etc., the cumulative return rate in the backtesting interval reached 132.74%; 3. The earliest exposure to the application of ML in the financial field; 4. Crawlers crawl web page information and perform text analysis.

### 2.1.2 Predicting Financial Fraud with AI: A Deep Learning Approach
- *Zhongnan University of Economics and Law*
- 2021.09 - 2022.02
- **Abstract**: 1. Use classic ML models for prediction (mainly divided into CNN and traditional models); 2. Use image information for prediction, rather than relying on numerical or textual information; 3. Early attention was paid to the interpretability issue of machine learning models, and corresponding solutions were proposed.

### 2.1.3 Large Language Models (LLM) Smart Q&A Robot: Prompt Engineering Research
- *Tianfeng Securities Co., Ltd., Data Finance Center*
- 2024.07 - 2024.09
- **Abstract**: 1. Business data support: Responsible for assisting in building the indicator system for subsidiary business reports and standardizing the design of data input and output. 2. Development of Large Language Model (LLM): Based on the temporary needs of management for business data, an intelligent question answering robot within the company has been developed. The robot mainly answers data questions based on databases of different business reports. The specific job I am responsible for is prompt engineering, which tests the stability of the robot through different business indicators, time, region, department keywords, and different ways of asking questions. The optimized Q&A robot achieves a 99% correct response rate. 3. Business Intelligence (BI) Cockpit Construction: Responsible for using Tableau to build BI dashboards and provide visual business analysis tools for management.
  
## 2.2 Efficiency Analysis, Economy & Econometric
### 2.2.1 Patent and Corporate Performance: A PCA-Based Analysis
- *The Chinese Academy of Sciences, Information Science Research Center*
- 2021.09 - 2022.06
- **Abstract**: 1. Multiple measurement indicators have been constructed for the operational performance of enterprises, and PCA method has been used for dimensionality reduction.

### 2.2.2 Carbon Emission Trading Policy and Chinese Firm's Green Productivity
- *Zhongnan University of Economics and Law*
- 2022.07 - 2023.07
- **Abstract**: 1. Use data envelopment analysis to measure enterprise productivity, using R language (because third-party packages do not support the setting of unexpected outputs) ->switch to Python (rewrite the DEA model for calculating multiple input-output using Python, but the problem is that the data is too large and the calculation speed is slow) ->switch to MATLAB (the advantage of matrix calculation is that the speed is relatively faster, about 1-2 hours). 2. Panel data of multiple variables and multiple years, involving missing value processing (first classify by year, if the missing proportion of variables is less than 10% - fill in the mean directly; then classify by enterprise, following the above missing value processing idea, if it is less than 10% - use the enterprise's mean, if it is between 10% and 30% - use interpolation processing, and so on). Continuously adjust the missing value processing The thinking makes the subsequent analysis more systematic. 3. Causal inference (double difference method) was used to test causal effects.

### 2.2.3 Research on Efficiency Maximization: Based on m-Frontier Approach
- *Zhongnan University of Economics and Law*
- 2023.02 - 2023.07
- **Abstract**: 1. Productivity frontier analysis, using m samples to form the frontier in the entire sample and calculating the efficiency of the samples; 2. Find the optimal value of m.

### 2.2.4 How Bank's Environment, Society, Government (ESG) affects the real economy performance
- *Zhongnan University of Economics and Law*
- 2023.12 - present
- **Abstract**: 1. Explore the relationship between Bank's ESG and its financial performance; 2. Find the effect of Bank's ESG on Firm's green productivity.

### 2.2.5 Photovoltaic Industry Innovation Efficiency: Structural Equation Modeling Analysis
- *Nanjing University*
- 2023.07 - 2024.07
- **Abstract**: 1. Transfer productivity methods to innovation efficiency measurement; 2. Structural equation estimation, multi-path estimation, and prediction were used.
